### SplitXML NOTES:

There are so many approaches to splitting a message body that I found it helpful to break it into different projects.

### Common to all Split___ Projects

There are often many different ways to split even just one kind of body. This is where Camel's "does everything to anything" approach can be a bit confusing. You don't want everything or anything, you want one specific approach that's going work for your use case.

So each Split___ example project has to show, or cross reference, working code that makes each of the relevant approaches work.

This also means that there is much duplication and/or cross referencing for each Split___ example project.
